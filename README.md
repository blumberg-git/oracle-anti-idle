# Oracle Anti-Idle System 🛡️

Never let your Oracle Cloud Free Tier instance get terminated due to inactivity!

**Author:** Matt Blumberg

## 🚀 Features

- **24/7 Automatic Operation** - Keeps your instance active continuously
- **Smart Resource Management** - Configurable CPU and memory usage
- **Auto-Recovery** - Automatically restarts if stopped or crashed
- **Health Monitoring** - System health checks before operations
- **Backup & Restore** - Configuration backup management
- **Systemd Integration** - Monitoring service for ultimate reliability
- **Beautiful CLI** - Modern menu-driven interface with ASCII art
- **Ubuntu Optimized** - Designed specifically for Ubuntu/Debian systems

## 📋 Requirements

- Ubuntu/Debian-based system (tested on Ubuntu 20.04/22.04)
- Root/sudo privileges
- Oracle Cloud Free Tier instance (or any Ubuntu VPS)

## ⚡ Quick Start

### One-Line Installation

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattblumberg/oracle-anti-idle/main/oracle-anti-idle.sh && \
sudo chmod +x oracle-anti-idle.sh && \
sudo ./oracle-anti-idle.sh
```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattblumberg/oracle-anti-idle.git
cd oracle-anti-idle
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x oracle-anti-idle.sh
```

3. Run the script:
```bash
sudo ./oracle-anti-idle.sh
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Interactive Menu

Simply run the script to access the interactive menu:

```bash
sudo ./oracle-anti-idle.sh
```

### Menu Options

1. **Toggle Anti-Idle** - Start/stop the anti-idle system
2. **Configure Parameters** - Customize CPU and memory usage
3. **Show Status** - View detailed system status
4. **Quick Setup** - Guided setup with presets
5. **Advanced Settings** - Access backup, monitoring, and more
6. **Health Check** - Perform system health assessment
7. **Help** - View help information
0. **Exit** - Exit the program

### Configuration Presets

- **Light** (10% CPU, 10% Memory) - Minimal impact
- **Standard** (15% CPU, 15% Memory) - Recommended ✓
- **Heavy** (25% CPU, 25% Memory) - Maximum prevention
- **Custom** - Set your own values

## 🔧 How It Works

The script uses `stress-ng` to generate controlled CPU and memory load, managed by `supervisor` for reliability. This activity prevents Oracle Cloud from marking your instance as idle.

### Components

1. **stress-ng** - Generates the actual CPU/memory load
2. **supervisor** - Manages stress processes and ensures they keep running
3. **systemd** - (Optional) Monitoring service for additional reliability
4. **watchdog** - Internal process monitor

## 🛡️ Reliability Features

### Auto-Recovery
- Processes automatically restart if they crash
- Supervisor restarts if it stops
- Systemd monitoring service (optional)

### Health Monitoring
- CPU temperature monitoring
- Memory availability checks
- Disk space validation
- Network connectivity verification
- Load average monitoring

### Backup System
- Automatic configuration backups
- Easy restore functionality
- Keeps last 5 backups

### Logging
- Comprehensive logging system
- Automatic log rotation (>50MB)
- Separate error and health logs
- Debug mode available

## 📊 Resource Usage

Default settings use minimal resources:
- **CPU**: 4 cores at 15% load each (adjustable)
- **Memory**: 15% of total RAM (adjustable)
- **Disk**: ~10MB for logs

## 🔐 Security

- Runs with root privileges (required for supervisor)
- No external dependencies except Ubuntu packages
- No data collection or external communication
- All operations are local to your instance

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Script won't start
```bash
# Check if running as root
sudo ./oracle-anti-idle.sh

# Check system compatibility
cat /etc/os-release
```

### Supervisor not found
```bash
# The script auto-installs dependencies, but if needed:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install supervisor stress-ng
```

### High resource usage
- Use the Configure Parameters option to reduce CPU/memory usage
- Try the "Light" preset for minimal impact

### Checking logs
```bash
# View system log
sudo tail -f /var/log/oracle-anti-idle/anti-idle.log

# View error log
sudo tail -f /var/log/oracle-anti-idle/error.log

# View health log
sudo tail -f /var/log/oracle-anti-idle/health.log
```
